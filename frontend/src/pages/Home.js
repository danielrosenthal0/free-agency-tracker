<p>Welcome to my attempt at an NBA free agency tracker. There are three pages - available free agents, confirmed transactions, and recent tweets from Shams and Woj. Unfortunately, the API I am using is free so it limits the amount of requests per second and per month so there is a good chance the app crashes and you may need to wait a little and refresh. Enjoy.</p>
